# TBET expression in tonsillar naive and memory B-cells

The aim of this repo is to assess the expression of TBET (TBX21) in naive and memory B-cells from our [tonsil atlas](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.24.497299v1.full).
This analysis is part of a project aimed at characterizing the expression and function of TBET in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
